## Data Sources & Verification

### Primary Source: BigQuery

**Dataset:** `numia-data.dydx_mainnet`

**Key Queries:**

1. **Top 5 Whales Query** - Aggregates all trades (maker + taker sides) and funding payments over 30 days
2. **Market Breakdown Query** - Calculates PnL by perpetual_id for each top whale

**Data Quality:**
- **Missing Values:** None (all trades have complete data)
- **Date Range:** Trailing 30 days from query execution
- **Conversion:** All values converted from quantums to USDC (1M quantums = 1 USDC)

### How to Verify

1. **Re-run data collection:**
   ```bash
   cd analyses/2025-11-19-13:33-top-5-whales-pnl/scripts
   python gather.py
   ```

2. **Check raw outputs:**
   - `outputs/top_5_whales.csv` - Whale rankings
   - `outputs/whale_market_breakdown.csv` - Market details

3. **Cross-reference with dYdX Explorer:**
   - Visit: https://www.mintscan.io/dydx
   - Search for whale addresses
   - Verify recent trading activity

## Methodology Notes

### PnL Calculation

**Trading PnL:**
```
Trading PnL = Σ(quote_balance_delta - fees_paid) for all trades
```

**Funding PnL:**
```
Funding PnL = -Σ(funding_paid_quote_quantums) for all positions
```
- Negative `funding_paid` = trader received funding (income)
- Positive `funding_paid` = trader paid funding (expense)

**Total PnL:**
```
Total PnL = Trading PnL + Funding PnL
```

### Data Completeness

- Both **maker and taker sides** of each trade are captured
- All **subaccounts** per address are aggregated
- **Fees are subtracted** from gross PnL for net calculation
